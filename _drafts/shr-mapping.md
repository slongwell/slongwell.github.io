- definition: mass accelerated by 1 ft/s^2 from a force of one pound

No name has yet been given to the unit of mass and, in fact, as we have developed the theory of dynamics no name is necessary. Whenever the mass, m, appears in our formulae, we substitute the ratio of the convenient force-acceleration pair (w/g), and measure the mass in lbs. per ft./sec.2 or in grams per cm./sec.2. â€‰(Noel Charlton Little, College Physics, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1928, p. 165.)
- if I could go back in time and slap...
- mass is an inherent property of matter (classically, anyways)
- specific number of  (nevermind that 1 g water ~ 1 mL water)
