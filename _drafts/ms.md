Do you do top down proteomics?
Do you see things that look like this?
[][]

Then you can quickly estimate the mass of your protein with this formula:

$M = \frac{(x_1 - H)(x_2 - H)}{x_1 - x_2}$

Where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the (m/z) of two adjacent peaks in the distribution.

Electro-spray Ionization (ESI) sources tend to produce multiply charged ions. While small molecules (\is_approx 300 m/z$) typically give only 1-3 charges, larger molecules can have dozens of charge states. This is in that it a) splits up signal and b) makes the more difficult to  The larger the molecule, . This is both a strength and a 

A high-resolution mass spectrometer can distinguish between:

However.
