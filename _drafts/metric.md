I feel strongly - nay (link to horse), absolutely - about few things. The

There are . The failed [Mars orbiter]

Obvious examples (mars orbiter, network chart vs 10s)

Short list of 'natural equivalents':

slugs (blob/slinch)
- definition: mass accelerated by 1 ft/s^2 from a force of one pound
- also lb-f vs lb-m vs lb (avoirdupois) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(force) 

No name has yet been given to the unit of mass and, in fact, as we have developed the theory of dynamics no name is necessary. Whenever the mass, m, appears in our formulae, we substitute the ratio of the convenient force-acceleration pair (w/g), and measure the mass in lbs. per ft./sec.2 or in grams per cm./sec.2. â€‰(Noel Charlton Little, College Physics, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1928, p. 165.)
- if I could go back in time and slap...
- fails to treat mass as an inherent property of matter (classically, anyways)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilogram#Nature_of_mass (bathroom scale vs balance)
- with force, you bring in the interation
- variation in g across earth is significant (xkcd: local g, wolfram alpha: http://www.wolframalpha.com/widgets/view.jsp?id=e856809e0d522d3153e2e7e8ec263bf2)

- insteresting to read about specific number of silicon (nevermind that 1 g water ~ 1 mL water)

80 kg ~ 176 lbs (avg american)
london, 9.81599: 785.2792 N = 176.537787 lbs
rio 9.78575: 782.86 N = 175.993929 lbs
lose half a pound, i.e. -0.3% in rio
