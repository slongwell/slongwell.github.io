Symlinks: `ln -s source target`

Hardlinks: `ln source target`

Aliases: [see here][aliases]


In general, making a shortcut involves a *source* and *target*:
* source: the existing file/folder  
* target: the 'link' that will be created

On Unix, there are two main types of links: *symbolic links* and *hardlinks*. Mac OS X adds a third to the mix via the Finder: *aliases*. While all three can be thought of as 'shortcuts', they have distinct behaviors that are important to note:
 
* Symbolic links (aka symlinks, softlinks) point to a file or folder at a specific path. If the source file is moved, the link will be broken.

* Hardlinks are to a specific source [inode][inode], which uniquely identifies a file. If the source file is moved, the link will persist. 

* Aliases are created by the Finder application. (*Note*: they are distinct from bash command aliases.) In a sense, they subsume symlinks and hardlinks. When an alias is clicked, it first behaves like a symlink, checking the source path. If no file is present at the source path, the system will then search for the inode of the original file.
