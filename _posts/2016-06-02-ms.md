Do you do top down proteomics?
Do you see things that look like this?

Then you can quickly estimate the mass of your protein with this formula:

$$M = \frac{(x_2 - H^+)(x_1 - H^+)}{x_2-x_1}$$

Where $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ are the $$(m/z)$$ of two adjacent peaks in the charge envelope.

For example, taking the two largest consecutive peaks above, we have:

$$x_1 = 998.37$$ m/z  
$$x_2 = 1060.65$$ m/z  
$$H^+ = 1.01$$ m/z

$$M = \frac{(1060.65 - 1.01)(998.37 - 1.01)}{1060.65 - 998.37} = 16969.21$$

Want a better estimate? 

$$z_1 = \frac{(x_2 - H^+)}{x_2-x_1} = \frac{(1060.65 - 1.01)}{1060.65 - 998.37} = $$

Electro-spray Ionization (ESI) sources tend to produce multiply charged ions. Small molecules ($$\sim300$$ m/z) typically give only 1-3 charges, but larger molecules can have dozens of charge states. This is in that it explodes things, reducing signal and making the spectrum more difficult to interpret. However, it can allow larger molecules, even 100 kDa proteins, visible within at 3200 m/z.

A high-resolution mass spectrometer can distinguish between:

However.
