<p>In general, making a shortcut involves a <em>source</em> and <em>target</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>source: the existing file/folder</li>
  <li>target: the ‘link’ that will be created 
<!--more--></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>On Unix, there are two main types of links: <em>symbolic links</em> and <em>hardlinks</em>. Mac OS X adds a third to the mix via the Finder: <em>aliases</em>. While all three can be thought of as ‘shortcuts’, they have distinct behaviors that are important to note:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Symbolic links (aka symlinks, softlinks) point to a file or folder at a specific path. If the source file is moved, the link will be broken.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hardlinks are to a specific source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode">inode</a>, which uniquely identifies a file. If the source file is moved, the link will persist.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aliases are created by the Finder application. (<em>Note</em>: they are distinct from bash command aliases.) In a sense, they subsume symlinks and hardlinks. When an alias is clicked, it first behaves like a symlink, checking the source path. If no file is present at the source path, the system will then search for the inode of the original file.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
